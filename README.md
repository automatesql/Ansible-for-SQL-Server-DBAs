# Ansible-for-SQL-Server-DBAs Examples
This repository contains Ansible examples developed to support different YouTube videos and the Ansible for SQL Server DBAs courses (coming soon).  Sign up to be the first to know when the course releases at https://www.automatesql.com/ansible.

Many of the examples can be performed in a virtual lab, as long as the lab contains a Windows domain, a Windows Server 2022 machine with WSL installed, and two to three target VMs to install and configure SQL Server on.  If you need a lab, the Automated Sandbox Fundamentals course may be of interest - https://www.automatesql.com/asf.

If you're new to Ansible, I'd highly recommend watching Jeff Geerling's, Ansible 101, playlist on Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/@JeffGeerling.
